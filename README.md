# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Scikit-Learn & MLflow

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease using patient medical data.
The project uses **Scikit-learn**, **MLflow**, and **Git version control** to follow an ML Engineer–style workflow.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

* Build a classification model to predict heart disease
* Use a Scikit-learn Pipeline (StandardScaler + LogisticRegression)
* Track experiments, metrics, and model using MLflow
* Version control the project using Git and GitHub

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given medical attributes of patients such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., the model predicts whether the patient is likely to have heart disease.
